# Navigation and State Estimation

018827 - [Advanced Applications in Inertial Systems](https://www.graduate.technion.ac.il/Subjects.Heb/?SUB=018827&SEM=201702).


**Syllabus** :
Navigation filters, precise methods for IMU initializations, satellite systems and inertial navigation systems integration,
information fusion with measurable and external data, pedestrian navigation and gyro-free navigation.

The course's final project exhibits a full navigation solution with noised IMU and GPS
sensors, estimated by EKF, and pronounced in a set of kinematic and global states along the scenario :

Unlike the position that is being corrected by the observation itself ( zÌƒ_GPS ), here the errors
worsen along time, as they evolve in a random walk :

)

The final and most important expression of the IMU drift, can be seen in the
overall trajectory whose estimated course deviates exponentially over time, w.r.t to GT :

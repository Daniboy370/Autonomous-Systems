# Navigation and State Estimation

A collection of codes and algorithms I gathered along my my Master's in the Technion incluing :
Navigation, State estimation (KF & EKF), Vision Aided Navigation and SLAM.

018827 - [Advanced Applications in Inertial Systems](https://www.graduate.technion.ac.il/Subjects.Heb/?SUB=018827&SEM=201702).

**Syllabus** :
Navigation filters, precise methods for IMU initializations, satellite systems and inertial navigation systems integration,
information fusion with measurable and external data, pedestrian navigation, gyro-free navigation, underwater navigation.

Demonstration from final project :

086761 - [Vision Aided Navigation](https://www.graduate.technion.ac.il/Subjects.Eng/?Sub=86761).

**Syllabus** :
Inertial and Dead Reckoning Navigation, Probabilistic Information Fusion, Vision Aided Navigation, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, Imu Pre-Integration, Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment, Cooperative Navigation and Slam (Centralized and Distributed), Active State Estimation and Belief-Space Planning.

086759 - [Navigation Systems](https://www.graduate.technion.ac.il/Subjects.Eng/?Sub=86759).

**Syllabus** :
Orientation Parametrization, Major Coordiante Frames in Navigation Systems, 3D Rigid Transformation Between Different Coordinate Frames, Dynamics, Inertial Sensors, Inertial Navigation Equations, Earth Model, Sensor Error Characteristics, Inertial Error Prograation, GNSS, Overview of Ins-GPS Ekf. 
1. Learn the Operating Principles and the Underlying Equations of Inertial Navigation Systems. 
2. Learn to Perform Analysis to Inertial Navigation Errors. 
3. Get Familiar with Principle of Operation of GNSS Systems.

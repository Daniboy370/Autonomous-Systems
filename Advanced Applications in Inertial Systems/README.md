# EKF for a strapdown model
 > Technion course : Advanced Applications in Inertial Navigation Systems (018827)
 
Online demonstration of EKF estimation performance w.r.t several IMU/GPS fusion ratio, and thus the evolving of the corresponding error. Requires basic *Matlab* installation without further packages.

Unlike the position that is being corrected by the observation itself ( zÌƒ_GPS ), the errors
worsen along time, as they evolve in a random walk :

The final and most important expression of the IMU drift, can be seen in the
overall trajectory whose estimated course deviates exponentially over time, w.r.t to GT :
